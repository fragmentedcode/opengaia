# OpenGAIa

## Description

I am very angry right now and I need a 
project to focus on to keep me CALM!

I am interested in plants, garndening,
horticulture, botany and pharmacognosy
(the study of medicines obtained from
plants and other natural sources)

I don't have a particular aim for this
project as I am going to use it to help
me deal with a lot of s**t so feel to do
whatever

-- Merlin            

## The Rules

I want to keep this project as greenfield as possible. I have been a developing for over 18 years now so know that it is
foolish and ridiculous to rule out using external libraries however I have also seen the kind of dependancy hell and code
bloat that can occur in larger projects which makes a developer want to smash the computer with a hammer. For this reason 
I have decided that the use of gargantuan frameworks (such as Symfony, Laravel etc.) and tools (such as Composer) is not 
allowed here, fork off if you want to go in another direction.

By keeping it this way it will keep me CALM and keep it simple enough for someone who is new to developement to understand
rather than being obfuscated in layers of "framework", which is great for students!

## The Tech Req

Server
PHP 8.2+
MySQL/MariaDB

## What's happening?

- Creating a simple user interface with Bootstrap to facilitate CRUD operations 
for the time, a future version will be driven by a REST API so will need writing
to use AJAX or similar. I might use Fusio to implement the API to save myself a
a lot time.
